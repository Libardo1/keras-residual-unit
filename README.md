# Keras Customizable Residual Unit 

This building block shows you how to easily incorporate custom residual connections into your Keras neural networks. I spent longer than I'd have liked trying to add these blocks to my models and thought I'd share it with the world.

Run `python residual.py` to get a model built and a png to peruse.

This is an implementation of the full pre-activation residual unit from He, K., Zhang, X., Ren, S., Sun, J., "Identity Mappings in Deep Residual Networks" (http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.05027v2).
